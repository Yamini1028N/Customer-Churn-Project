Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn, using data analysis techniques, visualizations, and machine learning models to predict churn and gain insights into factors that contribute to customer retention.

Project Overview
In this project, I implemented:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the dataset, examine trends, and identify key features that might impact customer churn.
Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and other Python libraries to create insightful plots that highlight important patterns in the data.
Machine Learning Models: Built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict customer churn, including:
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Dataset
The dataset includes various features related to customer demographics, usage, and account details. The target variable, Churn, indicates whether a customer has left the service.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:

Analyze feature distributions
Identify correlations between variables
Detect any potential data quality issues (e.g., missing values, outliers)
Data Visualization
Visualizations were created using Seaborn to:

Display distributions of important features
Explore relationships between features and churn
Model Building
The following models were implemented to predict customer churn:

Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Each model was evaluated using a train-test split and various metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) to compare their performance.

Results
Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy, making it the most effective model for this dataset.
Decision Tree provided interpretability, allowing us to understand feature importance.
Conclusion
The project demonstrated that specific customer attributes significantly impact churn. Logistic Regression emerged as the best model for predicting churn in this dataset.

Future Work
Experiment with other machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Implement cross-validation to improve model generalization.
Enhance feature engineering to better capture customer behaviors.
